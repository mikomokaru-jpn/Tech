Full-text search process for a file system is expected to target  the number of files on the order of thousands to tens of thousands.
If you want the turn around time shorten, it is efective that  you divide one process  into  multiple processes and execute them in parallel.
As a result of modifying <a href='../B40/findingWords.html' target="_blank">full-text text search tool  No.1</a> to parallelization and executing it, I found  that a considerable effect can be expected.
</div>
<h3 class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
Parallelization requirements
</h3>
<div class="lm100 tm5 rm60">
Divide all files to be searched into 2 to 10 and perform  text search processes individually in parallel for each file group, 
and merge the results after all the processes are completed.
The results are finally sorted, so the order of each processing does not matter.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60">
Display the progress rate of the process in the progress bar of the window.
A progress rate is a ratio of a number of processed files to total number of files.
However, from the point of efficiency, this function does not work with a  number of files (1,000) or less.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60">
Cancellation of processing can be accepted in the middle of processing. 
The process is stopped immediately when stop button is clicked.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60">
If the number of target files is too large, the process will take a long time, 
so if the number of files exceeds 100,000, a warning dialog will be displayed and the user can cancel the process.

Implementation points
</h3>
<h3 class="lm100 tm0 rm60 bm0">
(1) Multi-thread processing
</h3>
<div class="lm100 tm5 rm60 bm0">
The parallelization of processing uses multi-thread function GCD. The queue is concurrent.
Subthread processing is asynchronous  in order to enable to display data to UI and to get events from UI.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
After all text search processes by subthread has been completed, the list is created and displayed.
These processes are implemented with delegate method.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
UI operations need to be done in  main thread, and if you try to do it  from  sub thread, 
you must re-queue the function  to be done to main thread.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
Be careful when multiple subthreads process executed concurrently update properties of an object.
For example, when adding an element to an array, this process is not thread-safe and can cause a system crash due to a conflict of multiple  assignments.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
Then, there is a process that it  first gets a currentry value of the property , updates it, 
and then rewrites it back the property. it is a multi-step process.
So if many number of subthreads execute this process at the same time, 
the consistency of each process  is not guaranteed, and unexpected results are likely to occur.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
In such cases, you should queue the processing block to serial queue, so sequential processing is guaranteed and problems can be avoided.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
In this application, as the above example, the following two processes are executed in main thread via serial queue.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
1. Merge the records of individual search results into the aggregation table.
</div>
<div class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
2. Add the number of processed files for each thread to current total number. This value is displayed in the progress bar as progress.
</div>
<h3 class="lm100 tm10 rm60 bm0">
(2) Processing synchronization
</h3>
<div class="lm100 tm5 rm60 bm0">
Wait for the end of all the search processes have been executed in parallel, and then create the list of results. 
This requires synchronous control.
Here, a global counter is prepared, the counter is incremented each time one search process is completed, 
and when all the processes are completed, a delegate method that creates and displays the list of result is called.
</div>
<h3 class="lm100 tm20 rm60 bm0">
Execution log output

<div class="lm100 tm5 rm60 bm0">
